# KUCC Git & GitHub Reference Library & Presentation 

Welcome to the **KUCC Git & GitHub Masterclass and Hands-On Workshop** repository! Organized by the **Kathmandu University Computer Club (KUCC)**, this project is designed specifically for first-year students to learn the fundamentals of modern version control, collaborative development, and team workflows.

This repository serves as both the backend for our live workshop assignment and a robust, permanent reference library you can bookmark and use for your semester projects.
